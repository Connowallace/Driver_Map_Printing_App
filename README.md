# Driver_Map_Printing_App
An application that allows users (truck drivers) to print out maps, reports, and tracking files. Also displays pictures and personal profiles of local team.

This application uses Microsoft PowerPoint as its UI, with VBA code to print slides from the slide show or print files from the local drive using Window's apiShellExecute.

This application allows drivers easy access to maps of all stores they deliver to, as well as forms they use in daily activities. This project has positively impacted multiple KPIs, including delivery time and safety. I am currently working on an instructional document to enable all other transportation offices in our region to build their own application.

I personally implemented all VBA code on this project. I've also performed all maintenance since we have begun using the application. Multiple people in my local office contributed to building and linking the slide show together.

This project taught me a lot about implementing VBA. I had to learn how to effectively use apiShellExcute calls, and how to have the code run on both 32 and 64 bit machines.
